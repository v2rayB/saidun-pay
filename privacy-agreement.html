			General information
		</h3>
		<div class="f1">
			Based on your usage of the service, SetonVPN may collect three (3) types of data, as shown below. You can find detailed information about them in specific sections below. If you have just visited our website, please refer to Section 7.
		</div>
		<div class="f1">
			(i) Personal data related to your account submitted ("Personal Data")
		</div>
		<div class="f1">
			Personal data refers to any information that can be used alone or in combination with other data to uniquely identify an individual. The purpose of collecting personal data is to provide you with our services, including preventing fraudulent registration or account hijacking.
		</div>
		<div class="f1">
			(ii) Aggregating Application and VPN Connection Summary Statistics ("Usage Statistics")
		</div>
		<div class="f1">
			Collect the minimum amount of usage statistics to maintain excellent customer support and service quality. Such data does not include information about user browsing and Internet activities, including information when connecting to VPN - we will not collect (and therefore will not use, disclose or store) data queries or user IP addresses about VPN traffic, DNS content or destinations.
		</div>
		<div class="f1">
			(iii) Anonymous application diagnostics, including crash reports ("Application Diagnostic Data") (optional)
		</div>
		<div class="f1">
			Application diagnostic data, including crash reports, availability diagnostics, and VPN connection diagnostics, are anonymous data that cannot be associated with individual users. This feature is similar to the "Send Error Report" option. By default, application diagnostic data is not shared. You must select (for example, through the application's settings menu) to send application diagnostic data to us.
		</div>
		
		<h3 style="margin-top: 30px;">
			Personal data
		</h3>
		<div class="f1">
			SetonVPN collects personal data you provide by creating or updating an account.
		</div>
		<div class="f1">
			In addition, we also collaborate with trusted partners to simplify login processes, detect fraudulent registrations, and prevent account hijacking. These partners may obtain user IP addresses when IP links are generated, but these addresses are always stored separately from systems unrelated to these purposes; Never be able to connect with any user's online behavior, as no records of such behavior will be collected; For the convenience of users using the product, the storage records generated when the IP is effectively linked will always be permanently deleted after 6 months.
		</div>
		<div class="f1">
			The reason why SetonVPN uses your email address is as follows:
		</div>
		<div class="f1">
			We provide you with access to our services, including password reset or email verification.
		</div>
		<div class="f1">
			Send you updates and announcements.
		</div>
		<div class="f1">
			Communicate with you about your account or reply to your communication.
		</div>
		<div class="f1">
			Send marketing messages, such as content related to discounts, surveys, invitations, and other matters related to SetonVPN that we believe you may be interested in ("marketing emails"). You can choose not to receive marketing emails by following the unsubscribe program described in these emails.
		</div>
		
		<div class="f1 d1">
			SetonVPN only uses your personal data for the purposes listed in this privacy policy, and we will not sell or rent your personal data to third parties. We collect and process your personal data for the legitimate interests stipulated by applicable laws, and more specifically, to fulfill our contractual obligations towards you (i.e. according to the agreement between you and SetonVPN).
		</div>
		<div class="f1">
			Any personal information related to the SetonVPN account is only controlled by SetonVPN, including storage on systems, servers, and services owned or leased by SetonVPN and its subsidiaries. In limited cases where this data may need to be processed by other relevant entities, it can only be shared for the required time when necessary, for processing purposes only related to the purposes and legitimate interests outlined in this privacy policy, while ensuring that the same data protection standards are always used.
		</div>
		
		<h3 style="margin-top: 30px;">
			How do we protect and retain your personal data
		</h3>
		<div class="f1">
			Safety. We have implemented first-class physical, procedural, and technical security measures for our offices and information storage facilities to prevent the loss, misuse, or unauthorized access, disclosure, or modification of your personal data. Although we believe these systems are powerful, it is important to understand that there is no data security measure in the world that can provide completely reliable protection. Therefore, our guiding principle is to collect the least amount of data.
		</div>
		<div class="f1">
			Server and data center. The server is located in a data center with strong security measures. These data centers do not require us to collect or store any traffic data or personal data related to your use of services. If any data center requires us to record such data, we will immediately cease operations with the service provider and seek alternative options.
		</div>
		<div class="f1">
			Keep your personal data. Your personal data (to reiterate, it does not include any sensitive data such as browsing history, DNS queries, or IP addresses related to that information or any other online behavior) will be protected under applicable data protection laws (as long as we obtain your consent or legitimate reasons for holding such data). You can request the deletion of your data by sending a valid deletion request (see Section 11). Please note that if you request the deletion of your personal data, you will no longer be able to use the service.
		</div>
		<div class="f1">

		</div>
		
		<h3 style="margin-top: 30px;">
			How do we protect your personal data related to service providers
		</h3>
		<div class="f1">
			The agents, contractors, and third-party service providers ("service providers") of SetonVPN may control access to relevant data to assist us in processing payments, managing services, or otherwise assisting us in operating our business. All service providers who may access such data have confidentiality and data processing obligations to ensure the confidentiality of the data, and may not use it for any other purpose except for executing services on behalf of SetonVPN. These obligations include contractual commitments to protect data in accordance with applicable legal requirements, including obligations related to the transfer of personal data from the EU/European Economic Area to third countries.
		</div>
		<div class="f1">
			Service providers can only access the data required for services performed on behalf of SetonVPN, and will not include VPN activity or connection data under any circumstances, as we do not collect such data.
		</div>
		<div class="f1">
			In addition to service providers, if you agree to our sharing or transmission of your personal data (such as marketing consent or optional additional services or features), we may share your personal data.
		</div>
		
		<h3 style="margin-top: 30px;">
			Using statistical data and application diagnostic data
		</h3>
		<div class="f1">
			In order to maintain excellent customer support and service quality, SetonVPN will collect certain information related to your VPN usage, as described below. The data we collect for this purpose is strictly visible to our employees according to the principle of need to know, and may be shared with service providers for the aforementioned purposes, but always kept confidential.
		</div>
		<div class="f1">
			We ensure that statistical data and application diagnostic data never contain any sensitive information, which aligns with our overall commitment to never record browsing history, traffic destinations, data content, IP addresses, or DNS queries.
		</div>
		<div class="f1">
			Our minimum data collection principle for VPN usage statistics means:
		</div>
		<div class="f1">
			We don't know which user has visited a specific website or service before.
		</div>
		<div class="f1">
			We don't know which user connected to the VPN at a specific time or which VPN server IP address they used.
		</div>
		<div class="f1">
			We do not know the original IP address set of any given user's computer.
		</div>
		<div class="f1">
			If anyone attempts to force SetonVPN to publish user information based on any of the above content, we will not be able to provide this information as the data does not exist.
		</div>
		<div class="f1">
			Applications and application versions
		</div>
		<div class="f1">
			We collect information related to the applications and application versions activated by you to use our services. Understanding your current application version enables our support team to address any technical issues you may encounter.
		</div>
		
		<h3 style="margin-top: 30px;">
			Connection successful
		</h3>
		<div class="f1">
			When you use this application, we collect information about whether you successfully established a VPN connection on a specific date (but not at a specific time of the day), to which VPN location (but not the outgoing IP address assigned to you), and from which VPN connection. Country/ISP (but not your source IP address). These minimal pieces of information can help us provide technical support, such as identifying connection issues, providing country specific recommendations on how to best use our services, and enabling SetonVPN engineers to identify and fix network issues.
		</div>
		<div class="f1">
			Total amount of data transmitted (in MB)
		</div>
		<div class="f1">
			We collect information about the total amount of data transmitted by specific users. Although we provide unlimited data transmission, if we find that the traffic pushed by a single user is greater than the sum of thousands of other users, which affects the service quality of other SetonVPN users, we may contact the user for explanation.
		</div>
		
		<h3 style="margin-top: 30px;">
			Summarize using statistical data
		</h3>
		<div class="f1">
			In summary, we collect the least amount of usage statistics to maintain our service quality. For example, we may know that our client John connected to our VPN location in New York on Tuesday and transmitted a total of 823 MB of data within 24 hours. It is not possible to uniquely determine John's responsibility for any specific online behavior, as his usage patterns overlap with thousands of other SetonVPN customers who are also connected to the same location on the same day.
		</div>
		<div class="f1">
			Our designed system can completely eliminate the storage of sensitive data. We may know that the user has already used the SetonVPN, but we cannot identify the user individually, and we will never know how they use our services. We adhere to our firm commitment to user privacy and do not have access to any data related to user online activities.
		</div>
		
		<h3 style="margin-top: 30px;">
			Application diagnostic data
		</h3>
		<div class="f1">
			Under the license you choose to join, we will collect anonymous application diagnostic data, including crash reports, availability diagnostics, and VPN connection diagnostics. We use this data in network operation tools to help optimize network speed, and let us identify problems and areas for improvement related to specific applications, VPN servers or Internet service providers (ISPs). The diagnostic data we receive from this application is completely anonymous and cannot be associated with individual users (i.e., we do not store which user sent which data, nor do we store the user's IP address).
		</div>
		<div class="f1">
			If you choose to share this information with SetonVPN (in the settings menu of your account), we will collect the following anonymous application diagnostic data:
		</div>
		<div class="f1">
			Diagnostic information on whether VPN connection attempts have failed and how they have failed.
		</div>
		<div class="f1">
			Speed test data.
